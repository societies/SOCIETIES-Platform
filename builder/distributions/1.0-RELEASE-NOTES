Platform Features in Release 1.0:

Virgo Platform Services

- org.societies.activityfeed
-- Provides an generic activity feed service that can be integrated with platform or 3 party services allowing for relevant activity 
posts. In this release the activity is integrated with the CIS manager to associate activity feeds with created communities.
- org.societies.security 
-- low level security services, providing digital signatures to 3rd party services and policy negotiation process
-- service policy negotiation, providing service client with access to service resources
-- CIS policy negotiation
- org.societies.privacy.and.trust
-- The Trust Management & Evaluation framework provides the necessary infrastructure for 
the maintenance and management of dynamically changing trustworthiness of stakeholders with respect to different domains of 
collaboration. In this context, is assists an individual to assess the trustworthiness of the entities with whom they interact, 
such as, other users, communities and services. Trust assessment is currently based on the experiences of the end-user.
-- The Privacy Protection provides the necessary infrastructure to protect user's personal data. On the first hand, before 
each third party service installation, or CIS joining, the user is prompted to accept the corresponding privacy policy and 
modify his privacy preferences in consequences to protect his data exactly as he wanted. On the other hand, every time one 
of the user's personal data is requested, the Privacy Preferences Engine checks the user's will, or ask the user for feedback, 
before to release access to it.
- org.societies.css.devicemgmt
-- This component is the focal point for interaction with external devices. When a new device is detected via a specific device 
driver, the latter driver informs this component which assigns it a Device ID. It then creates and maintains the device binding 
table adding the device to both the Device Registry and the Service Registry. If the device is tagged as a â€œcontext sourceâ€�, it 
can raise an internal event to inform the context component of the status of the device (connected, disconnected, updated data).
- org.societies.context.management
-- It provides the functionality regarding the representation, collection, management, and sharing of context information and 
the inference of higher level context attributes, in order to support the provision of context-aware experience to the css users. 
-- The context model is used in order to represent all the necessary  information that describes the situation of a CSS entity 
or a group of  entities that form a CIS. 
-- The Context Broker component  manages access to current, past and  future context data. The past context refers to the data 
stored in the  context history database. The future context information is provided on  the fly based on context prediction methods. 
The Context Broker also  supports distributed context queries; it is a gateway to context data  and decides whether the local DB, 
a remote DB or the Context Inference  Management need to be contacted to retrieve the requested context data.     
- org.societies.css.management
-- This component is responsible for managing the information relating to the CSS in terms of the users profile information, 
logging in and out CSS nodes, CSS Advertisements and managing CSS users friends, returning suggested friends list filtered from 
the user's social network connectors and CSS Directory advertisements and providing the interface to allow friend requests to be 
sent and managed (accept, reject, remove etc..)
- org.societies.cis.management
-- The CisManagementBundle service exposes the Community/CIS management functions of the Societies platform. It offers an API for 
managing (creating, modifing, joining, leaving and deleting) a CIS, its members and its activity feed. This bundle is also the 
responsible of hosting the CISs created in its virgo container (the CISs created by the local CSS).
- org.societies.service-lifecycle
-- This component is responsible for mantaining and managing third-party services inside the platform, allowing users to add and 
remove services, discover services on their own CSS or on CIS and also share services with CISs. It exposes methods that allow 
third-party services to obtain their own runtime information as perceived by the platform, which is necessary to make use of most 
SOCIETIES capabilities.
- org.societies.sns
-- SocialNetwork bundle is responsible to connect social networks with societies. With the use of specific connector, an user can 
log in in his/her account and pull data from that social network and save in the context of societies. Such data is translate in a 
common language with the use of open social data model. It is also possible to push data on behalf of the user. 
- org.societies.useragent
-- This component is responsible to proactively adapt user preferences and intents to 3rd party services. It resolves the conflict 
between user intents and user preferences and decides what to follow. Then it may invoke the 3rd party services with user intent 
or preferences. A set of user implicit and explicit feedback mechanisms are provided to allow users to control automated service 
adaption. Besides, user monitoring modules are implemented to track users' actions, behaviours and choices of 3rd party services.
- org.societies.personalisation
-- SOCIETIES Personalisation is based on four distinct behavioural models; Nested If-Then-Else based User Preferences, 
Dianne (Dynamic Incremental Assosiative Neural NEtwork), Conditonal Random fIelds uSer inTent (CRIST) and Context Aware User 
Intent (CAUI) models. These are continually evaluated, updated and predict or suggest actions to be implemented by the system to 
adapt the user's environment according to their wishes. In addition to the proactive implementation of personalisation, the 
component also exposes an interface that allows services to explicitly request user intent and preference actions when 
they need them. 

Virgo Platform Infrastructure:

- org.societies.domain-authority
-- Directory services for CSSs and CISs
-- REST file server: serving resources to authorized 3rd party service clients
- org.societies.css.commfrwk
-- The Communication Framework enables network communication based on XMPP, exposed through an high-level API that deals with 
CSS and CIS Identities and Java objects. The framework handles the translation of Identities into XMPP addresses as well as the 
serialization of the Java data objects (beans) and their routing to the appropriate component. Both Platform Services and Third 
Party services can use it to communicate with remote components.
- org.societies.webapp
-- Test Web UI for creating user accounts and managing CSSs/CISs

Android Platform Services:

- Community Manager: Administrate/manage communities that you own. Membership, shared services, moderate activity feed
- Community Subscriptions Manager: interact with communities that you are a member of
- Service Management: Display/control services installed on your cloud node. List/launch SOCIETIES 3rd Party services installed locally
- Privacy Policy Utilities: Component to create privacy policies from pre-defined templates and to convert policy XML into a readable 
UI format
- Social Networking: Add and authorise connectors to your social network sites (currently Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, Linked-in)
- Friends Management: Eventing system to notify you of friend requests/acceptances and general friends management features
- User Feedback: generic component supporting retrieval of user feedback for policy negotiation, access control requests
- CSS/CIS directory services: allows for the querying of users and communities in the centralised directory
- CSS Manager: responsible for managing all the platform services for the user, logging in/out, starting/stopping platform services, 
profile updates

Android Platform Application:

- Comms & Eventing: Android has an implementation of Communication Framework which integrates with the Intent mechanism. The received 
packets are unmarshalled into objects that implement Parcelable so that it can efficiently be sent over an Intent.
- HTML5 User Interface is the main GUI. 
- Phonegap plugins are used as the interop layer between the native platform services and the javascript of the user interface.
